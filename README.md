<h2> in dev branch is for the current development version which is most likely to be merged to live.
this is the branch to work off and make changes </h2>

start on software page as thats all thats being developed currently and has all new changes

website made originally for school project being developed for fun into something more but don't quote me on that, all the content of the website is junk just to give it some sort of purpose and is no way meant to be serious.

new to all this just trying to make something cool with self taught coding and practices with half baked ideas and implementations.

any help / feedback appreciated.

domains are https://bte1.netlify.app/software for in-dev and https://burrd.netlify.app/ & https://burrd.us.to for live
