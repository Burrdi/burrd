burrd website 

website made originally for school project being developed for fun into something more but don't quote me on that, all the content of the website in junk just to give it some sort of purpose and is no way meant to be serious.

new to all this just trying to make something cool with self taught coding and practices with half baked ideas and implementations.

any feedback / help appreciatied.

domains are https://burrd.netlify.app/ and https://burrd.us.to for main branch and for test branch https://bte1.netlify.app/
